# CS499 Computer Science Capstone    July 2022
 
 ## WELCOME
 
 
 
 
 
 My name is Samantha Pollard I am a current student attaining my Bachelor of Science from Southern New Hampshire University currently studying Computer Science. The purpose of this ePortfolio is to showcase my abilities and talents, this is just a visual tool to demonstrate my skills and value to a potential employer. All the content of this portfolio is a starting point to my abilities and skills as well as growth in key areas surrounding software design / engineering, data structures, databases, and algorithms.
Some of the artifacts will demonstrate my stronger skill in one category but illustrate other skills across key areas. The artifacts that I have chosen, have been enhanced and presented in the course requirements

# Professional Assesment

  I started out joining the US.Navy back in 2001. Where I was apart of the Supply Department, as a Petty Officer 3rd Class, in charge of ships store and inventory to eventually becoming in charge of the Barbershop for officers and Enlisted personnel. I completed my enlisment and was honorably discharged after two tours. Although I was fond on the Navy i just wasn't sure if I wanted to do that the rest of my life. So upon discharge I attended school for a while and recieved my Associates in Network Systems Administration, I still wasn't sure on what I wanted to do with that.

  in 2015 I started working for Northrup Grumman as an Electronic Technician 3 where I get to perform routine technical functions releated to the support of development engineering and ground support equipment activities such as design, test, checkout, fabrication, modification, and assembly of electronics and Electro-mechanical systems, experimental design circuitry, prototype models or specialized test equipment. 
  Applications may include analog, digital and/or video type circuits and logic systems. Guidance is readily available from superiors. Works from schematics, diagrams, written and verbal descriptions, layouts or defined plans to perform routine testing, checkout, troubleshooting, prototype building, environmental testing, and simple developmental engineering tasks. Performs routine operational tests and fault isolation on development systems and equipment to ensure conformance with design specifications.Diagnoses and isolates malfunctions down to component level. 
  
  Conducts defined engineering tests and collects data as assigned. Utilizes routine development or diagnostic equipment including oscilloscope, VOM, DVM, signal generators and similar test apparatus. Normally assigned in area such as development, engineering, test equipment design, or the like. Excludes those assigned to production test activities. Entry Level. Excludes trainees with no academic preparation or experience.Although I love what I do the plan was always to continue to make vertical moves within the company. so getting my degree in Computer Science was a must for me. Although this degree hasn't been easy on me, I have had many of road blocks that has tired to stop me from continuing this process.
regardless of the outcome, at least I tried my best and I never gave up that was always the most important part for me, to show my children that regardless of what's happened in life that I continued to keep going. With that being said, I have presented three artifacts that demonstrate my profeciancy in diffrent languages, databases and data structors.



# DAT 220: Fundamentals of Data Mining

the Artifact that I chose for this portion is from a previous class CS 260: Data Structure and Algorithms, a class that I took back in June of 2020. I have posted the original lab which was creating written in C++ The focus of these problems will be working with information extracted from a municipal government data feed containing bids submitted for auction of property.The data set is provided in two comma-separated files: 1.	eBid_Monthly_Sales.csv (larger set of 17,937 bids) and 
2.eBid_Monthly_Sales_Dec_2016.csv (smaller set of 179 bids)








# Algorithms and Data Structure

For this portion, I wanted to incorporate a previous class of mine CS250 Softeware Development Lifecycle, where I'm explaing with exapmle the Life Cycle of any software development from the planning phase icluding the 3 main and major points of any planning, which would be the Who, What, and Why. The purpose of this structure is to implement the idea of a program into creating stories and making sure the steps from begining to the finished product which is completed and understood for the customer.  










# Data Base

 Here are some examples of class work that I completed, for class DAT 220: Fundamentals of Data Mining.
 the premise of this module was to capture the online data of everyday retail traffic inorder to break down what merchandise is being sold and at what rate, as well as the amount of purchases within a certain amount of time. The second module, is showcased Bubba Gump Resturant, the purpose of this was to use the data that is provided to track the amount of purchases at the resturant locations or via the internet. the purpose was to gage the type of traffic to the resturant vs. the internet. What was found was that regarless if the resturant was local, sales weren't as high as they were via ordering the internet.

This paper refelects on my career choices and plans going forward into the future. evern through the bumps and road blocks I have remained constant in my path in Computer Science. 

[Journal: Capstone Reflection]

The paper that I have written is of my CS499 Computer Science Capstone assignments. this entry is about how I have reached my five - course outcomes by enhancing as well as including the artifacts into my ePortfolio as well as the accomplishments of being able to create a professional ePortfolio to showcase my kills, abilities, and knowledge within the  Computer Science field.
