 ## Self Assesment
 
 
 
 
 
 My name is Samantha Pollard I am a current student activley attaining my Bachelor of Science from Southern New Hampshire University currently studying Computer Science. The whole purpose of this ePortfolio is to showcase my abilities and talents, that I have learned while attending SNHU. This however is just a visual tool to demonstrate my skills and value to any potential employer(s). All the content of this portfolio is a starting point to my abilities and skills as well as my growth in key areas surrounding software design / engineering, data structures, databases, and algorithms.
Some of the artifacts will demonstrate my stronger skill in one category but illustrate other skills across key areas. The artifacts that I have chosen, have been enhanced and presented in the course requirements
